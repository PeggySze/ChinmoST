### Summary
**Maintenance of sex identity in stem cells** are important for gonad homeostasis and fertility. In adult Drosophila testes, the depletion of the JAK-STAT downstream effector Chinmo from somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) has been shown to cause feminization of these cells and overproliferation of early germ cells. However, the regulatory mechanisms by which Chinmo maintains the male identity of CySCs and promotes normal spermatogenesis remain poorly understood. By performing single-cell RNA-seq and Chinmo CUT&Tag assay on wild-type and mutant testes across different time points, we comprehensively profiled the changes of transcriptomes in different cell types, the intercellular communication network in mutant testes and identified the direct target genes of Chinmo. Overall, our study demonstrates that **somatic sex maintenance promotes normal spermatogenesis through Chinmo-mediated conserved sex determination and the insulin signaling pathway**. It offers new insights into the complex mechanisms underlying infertility, highlighting the direct link between disruptions in somatic sex maintenance and compromised fertility.
